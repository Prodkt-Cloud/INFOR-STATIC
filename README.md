## ðŸ‘€ Tovuti Notes

When calling to the API locally using MacOS Device you may encounter a connection error when executing calls to multiple endpoints. I found that I had an extra entry in my `hosts` of `::1 localhost`. To bypass this error and reach a successful fetch open your terminal and run `sudo nano /etc/hosts` and remove the entry `::1 localhost` and save. Retest your fetch and for me this resolved all issues.
